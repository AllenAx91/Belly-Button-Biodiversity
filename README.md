# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

Improbable Beef is a company setting out to identify the elusive bacteria that would act as the final key to synthesizing artificial meat. Interestingly, this bacteria could be one that resides in our belly button. Through this page, you can retrieve demographic information on bacterial data for each volunteer's belly button. Specifically, the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
